## Getting Started

The idea here is simple, create a composable Uniswap V2 pair that gives liquidity providers more control over their funds. The largest barrier to entry for new AMMs is lack of liquidity. Maintaining a competitive rate is almost impossible because slippage is high relative to competition. 

$$kRoot = \sqrt{actualInvariant}$$

$$tkRoot = \sqrt{targetInvariant}$$


$$ tk = (\frac{x ‚ãÖ tkRoot}{kRoot}) ‚ãÖ (\frac{y ‚ãÖ tkRoot}{kRoot}) $$

But what if we could simulate the slippage/price impact of more liquid pools in order to avoid this issue? The math above states we can solve for a reserve multiplier using the square root of *actualInvariant* and *targetInvariant*. This means we can scale reserves to imitate deeper pools in a predictable manner.



## Features

* ‚úÖRemoved Uniswap 0.05% mint fee
* ‚úÖAdded Swap fee customization
* ‚úÖAdded ERC3156 Flash-loan support
* ‚úÖOptional TWAP support
* ‚ôªÔ∏èTarget invariant support

## Development

**Setup**
```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

**Building**
```bash
make build
```

**Testing**
```bash
make test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./scripts/*`.

NOTE: For local deployment, make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` before running the `deploy_local.sh` script. Otherwise, hardhat will error due to missing dependencies.

NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs).

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

üéâ Foundry is installed! üéâ

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ü•≥

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol`](./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry and Dapptools, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository largely created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).

### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).
