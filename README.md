## Getting Started

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The idea here is simple, create a composable Uniswap V2 pair that gives liquidity providers more control over their funds. The largest barrier to entry for new AMMs is lack of liquidity. Maintaining a competitive rate is almost impossible because slippage is high relative to competition. However, what if we could simulate the slippage/price impact of more liquid pools in order to become more competitive?

![xy=k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=k) equals the constant product market curve where 
* ![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x) = token x reserves
* ![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y) = token y reserves
* ![k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) = constant number

First observe that ![k=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k=c^2) for some real number ![c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c) so we can rewrite  the constant product market curve as 

![xy=k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=k)

![xy=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=c^2)

=======
The idea here is simple, create an experimental AMM with more features at a lower gas cost. In my opinion, the largest barrier-to-entry for emerging AMMs is liquidity, or lack thereof. Offering a competitive rate can prove to be a formidable task when existing markets already have significantly more liquidity. Due to the nature of constant product market makers, the less liquidity pools have the more slippage their users incur while trading. However, what if we could imitate deeper pools, without the underlying liquidity?



Well, we know ![xy=k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=k) equals the constant product market curve where 
* ![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x) = token x reserves
* ![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y) = token y reserves
* ![k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) = constant/invariant

First observe that ![k=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k=c^2) for some real number ![c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c) so we can rewrite  the constant product market curve as 

![xy=k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=k)

![xy=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=c^2)

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
![xy=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=c^2)

![xy/c=c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{xy}{c}=c)

![1/c*xy=c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{1}{c}xy=c)


where ![\frac{1}{c}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?1/c) is the invariant of the constant product market curve. 

Suppose we want to target a specific constant ![k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) which directly allows us to control price impact on the pool. Observe again that we could let ![k=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k=c^2) for some real number ![c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c) such that ![c=ab](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c=ab) for ![a!=b](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?a&space;\neq&space;b). By controlling the values of ![a](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?a) and ![b](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?b), we can construct any ![k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) for any $xy$ pool. Note that if ![a=b](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?a=b), then we get the traditional constant product market curve. Working backwards from the above equation and replacing ![c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c) with ![a,b](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?a,b), we get



![(1/ab)xy=ab](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bg{white}\frac{1}{ab}xy=ab&space;)

![(xy/ab)=ab](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{xy}{ab}=ab)

![xy=(ab)^2=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=(ab)^2=c^2)

![xy=k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=k)



where ![k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) is now a different constant than the one we started with and

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

üéâ Foundry is installed! üéâ

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ü•≥

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol`](./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry and Dapptools, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository largely created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).
