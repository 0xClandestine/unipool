## Getting Started

The idea here is simple, create a composable Uniswap V2 pair that gives liquidity providers more control over their funds. The largest barrier to entry for new AMMs is lack of liquidity. Maintaining a competitive rate is almost impossible because slippage is high relative to competition. However, what if we could simulate the slippage/price impact of more liquid pools in order to become more competitive?

![xy=k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=k) equals the constant product market curve where 
* ![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x) = token x reserves
* ![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y) = token y reserves
* ![k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) = constant number

First observe that ![k=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k=c^2) for some real number ![c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c) so we can rewrite  the constant product market curve as 

![xy=k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=k)

![xy=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=c^2)

![xy=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=c^2)

![xy/c=c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{xy}{c}=c)

![1/c*xy=c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{1}{c}xy=c)


where ![\frac{1}{c}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?1/c) is the invariant of the constant product market curve. 

Suppose we want to target a specific constant ![k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) which directly allows us to control price impact on the pool. Observe again that we could let ![k=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k=c^2) for some real number ![c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c) such that ![c=ab](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c=ab) for ![a!=b](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?a&space;\neq&space;b). By controlling the values of ![a](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?a) and ![b](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?b), we can construct any ![k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) for any $xy$ pool. Note that if ![a=b](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?a=b), then we get the traditional constant product market curve. Working backwards from the above equation and replacing ![c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c) with ![a,b](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?a,b), we get



![(1/ab)xy=ab](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bg{white}\frac{1}{ab}xy=ab&space;)

![(xy/ab)=ab](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{xy}{ab}=ab)

![xy=(ab)^2=c^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=(ab)^2=c^2)

![xy=k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?xy=k)



where ![k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?k) is now a different constant than the one we started with and 
![xy=k](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?1/ab) is called the target invariant. ![square](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\square)

## Development

**Setup**
```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

**Building**
```bash
make build
```

**Testing**
```bash
make test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./scripts/*`.

NOTE: For local deployment, make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` before running the `deploy_local.sh` script. Otherwise, hardhat will error due to missing dependencies.

NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs).

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

üéâ Foundry is installed! üéâ

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://gakonst.xyz), tests are written in Solidity! ü•≥

Create a test file for your contract in the `src/tests/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol`](./src/tests/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry and Dapptools, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository largely created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).

### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).
